# SKYNET QR CODE GENERATOR

A Python QR code generator that publishes QR codes to Skynet and gets a skylink to share.
**Let's build a free internet**.


## Setup
You must install the following packages:
* [siaskynet](https://pypi.org/project/siaskynet/)
* [PyInputPlus](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/)
* [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/)


## Usage
In your terminal run the following command:
```
python3 qr_code_generator.py
```
After input a text or URL, the application generates a QR code with a timestamp which will be saved locally. 
And more important, it will be published to Skynet with a skylink that you can share with everyone.
